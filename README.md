# Happy (Birthday) Numbers
#### A sketch for my 32nd (a happy number) birthday (Feb 12)

> A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with
> any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its
> digits, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it
> will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those
> numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that
> do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).
